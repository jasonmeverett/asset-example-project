# [AlabamaASRL/asset_asrl](https://github.com/AlabamaASRL/asset_asrl) Project Template
This project template contains all dependencies necessary to make an ASSET project. No dependencies needed for configuration, just VS Code and Docker.

## How to Use
* Clone the repository.
* Open the folder in VS Code.
* Get the [Docker Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker).
* Add any custom python libraries you want to the `Dockerfile`.
* Open the Command Pallette (`[Cmd]`+`[Shift]`+`[P]`) and run `Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
* Wait a bit (first container build might take some time).
* Get to coding!
